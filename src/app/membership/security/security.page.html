        <h1>Security Information</h1>
        <p>Sherwood Forest is one of the safest neighborhoods in metro Atlanta. SFCA board takes
          the safety and security of neighbors, property, and visitors seriously. We have four
          active license plate readers at each entrance. We also have paid off-duty police
          officers on random shifts to maximize coverage patrolling our neighborhood.</p>
        <p>Emergency: Dial 911.</p>

            <p>
              My name is Lt. Jim Hodge and I am your neighborhood’s main security patrol officer.
              I would like to introduce myself to you all, provide my direct contact information
              and give you an update regarding my hours and recent police activity. It was a
              great pleasure to meet many of you at the summer picnic and look forward to meeting
              many more of you at other events as well as during my patrols. Please feel free to
              wave me down to say hi when you see me in the neighborhood.
            </p>
            <p>
              My direct contact, specifically for the patrol in your neighborhood is:<br>
              Email: sherwoodforestofficer@gmail.com<br>
              Phone: 404-558-3808
            </p>
            <p>
              Please feel free to contact me directly, at any time with matters of concern. I
              will do my very best to promptly reply with a solid answer or at least an artful
              dodge. I’ll provide information and will reach out to the Video integration unit
              regarding “hits” from the license plate cameras located at each of the entrances to
              Sherwood Forest.
            </p>
            <p>With permission of the SFCA board, I plan to send out the following on a regular basis:
            </p>
            <ion-list lines="none">
              <ion-item>1. My schedule for the upcoming week.</ion-item>
              <ion-item>2. Any crime updates that are relevant to Sherwood Forest, edited to protect privacy.</ion-item>
              <ion-item>3. Answer any questions you have for myself or APD in general</ion-item>
              <ion-item>4. Any relevant announcements and updates.</ion-item>
            </ion-list>
            <p>
              My hope is that by providing information directly to you, via email, your
              newsletter and Facebook page I will be able to keep you better informed as to what
              is happening in and around your neighborhood while keeping the privacy of victims
              and witnesses protected.
